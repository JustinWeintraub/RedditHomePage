# RedditHomePage
Link to project: https://weintraubreddit.herokuapp.com/

This is a project I created that uses python, flask, html, sql, and praw(for reddit). 
The function of this code is to scrape reddit, and store data of reddit posts into a sql database. 
The data is then used to display a custom home page for the reddit posts in flask. 
You can use the date feature to look at the posts for previous days if data was stored in the sql database for said day.
